        The closest example of what we are now familiar with, and has become one of the most famous meals in the world, originates from Naples during the middle ages. 
        The first recorded recipe of this version has been found as far back as the 14th century. This recipe was later evolved into the traditional lasagna of Naples' 
        lasagne di carnevale which is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta or mozzarella cheese and Neapolitan Rag√π.
